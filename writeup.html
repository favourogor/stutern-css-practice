        <h2 class="section">My Love For Tech</h2>
        <p id="first">My name is Favour Ogor. I am an undergraduate of the department of <i>Chemistry</i>, 
            University of Ibadan. Recently, I decided to switch career path to something else asides Chemistry.
        When I was a little younger (in my teenage years), I loved the sound of <strong>women in tech</strong>, it made me 
    get to understand that the technology world which I at first thought was male dominated, was not at all, 
and that what a man could do, a woman could do even better. Hence my love for tech, and the decision to switch
into it as a career path. Stutern has made the journey awesome ever since. Thank you Stutern!</p>

        <h2 class="section">What I Have Learnt so Far</h2>
        <p id="second">Since the beginning of my journey to becoming a Frontend web developer, I have learnt quite a lot.
            I have learnt that Frontend web development is an aspect of web development that deals with the 
            client side of a web page. In other words, it deals with the frontend aspect of a web page or web a
            web application, that is, how the layout of a web page or web app looks. A Frontend web developer 
            works closely with a UI/UX designer and a Backend web developer. In bringing a web page to live, 
            <strong>HTML</strong> <i>(HyperText Markup Language)</i>, <strong>CSS</strong> <i>(Cascading Style 
            Sheet)</i> and <strong>Javascript</strong> are used. HTML gives the page a structure. CSS is used in styling the page 
            structure. It makes the frontend of a website shine and it creates a good user experience. Without 
            CSS, websites and web apps would be less pleasing to the eye and most likely, much harder to 
            navigate. CSS is responsible for layout, format, color, and so on.</p>

        <h2 class="section">Margin, Border and Padding (Differences)</h2>
        <ul id="third">
            <li><strong>Padding:</strong>The <i>inner space</i> beetween the <i>content</i> and <i>Border
            </i>of your box.</li>
            <li><strong>Border:</strong>The <i>perimeter</i> of the box. Borders can be invisible or they could
            be a thin colored line.</li>
            <li><strong>Margin:</strong>The <i>outer space</i> (or lack of space) surrounding the box.</li>
        </ul>
